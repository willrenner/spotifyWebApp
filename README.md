## Spotify Web App

My Spotify Web App allows you to view your most played songs. To do this, the app requires you to authenticate through Spotify. After authentication is complete, you can view your most played songs from the last four weeks to the last several years. You can also select the number of songs to show, ranging from 10 to 50. All of this information is gathered through Spotify's API. The App itself is built with React.js, HTML, and CSS.
